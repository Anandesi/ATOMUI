NLP Wrapper Development Update

The NLP Wrapper is being developed as a configurable and extensible framework to support the integration of GenAI and NLP models within the ValOps ecosystem. The objective is to provide a unified interface for working with various transformer-based architectures, including:
	•	Encoder-only models
	•	Decoder-only models
	•	Encoder-Decoder models
	•	Embedding models

Implemented Modules:
	1.	HESequenceClassificationEncoder
	•	Supports encoder-only models for sequence classification tasks.
	•	Use Case ID: 15203 – Implements a binary classification model using DistilBERT-Base-uncased.
	•	Application: Detecting biased language in appraisal documents.
	•	Key Methods: get_embeddings(), predict_proba(), predict()
	2.	HEDecoder
	•	Supports decoder-only models for generative tasks.
	•	Use Case ID: 15300 – Generates AI-based summaries of customer phone call transcripts using chat_completion().
	•	Key Methods: chat_completion(), fine_tune(), get_probabilities()
